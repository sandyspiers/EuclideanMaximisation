# The Euclidean Max-Sum Cutting Plane Algorithm (EMSCA)

## OA-MIPS

In short:
We begin with a cut from max cardinality.
Then, we use Theorem 1b to assure each cut generated by the **optimal solution** of the outer approximation problem always creates a valid cut.
Therefore, we make no assumption on cardinality, **but** we must solve a MIP to optimality every time.

## Decreasing Cardinality

In short:
We start by fixing the cardinality to max, and solve using branch and cut.
We then decrease the cardinality by 1, but preserve all the cuts.
This is continued until UB < LB, in which case stop.
